To send github file, we first need to download our repository from github using..

git clone "Your_Repo_link"

After cloning the repo, we locate it and write our code inside the repo, 

Once we done writing it and want to send it back to the repo, we then need to write these codes,

git add .

git commit -m "my commit"

goit push.


Voallah!! You are done!!
